# A_star_simulator
This simulator helps to **create maps/fields** and save as separete file (mode 1), 
**locate finite amount of pivots on the field** created by mode 1 and save as separete file (mode 2)
and **test A* algorithm** with heuristics (mode 3) of two kinds:
* Differential heuristic - DF
* Canonical heuristic - CH

The paper those heuristics are based on is inside this repository.

Some pictures from the simulator, how it looks like:
